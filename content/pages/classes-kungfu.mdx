      ## Instructor: Sifu Matt Preston


      After stoking an interest in martial arts and training from a young age in
      Canada, it was time to set off abroad to explore the source of these
      combat and internal cultivation techniques. Along with other countries in
      Asia, Teacher Matthew Preston lived in Taiwan, Republic of China for over
      two decades, where he studied several authentic, traditional martial arts
      lineages. Rather than modern wushu dances with flowery forms, these arts
      originate from practical and well-known martial schools and instructors.
      This is as “authentic” as Kung Fu gets, and is quite unique to this part
      of the world. The main curriculum draws heavily from Xingyi Quan, Bagua
      Zhang, Taijiquan, as well as other Shaolin arts. 


      ## Classes Taught


      Teacher Matthew currently runs the Deep Water Kung Fu & Tai Chi classes at
      the center, hoping to share this knowledge with as many people as possible
      in the local area. Get in touch for more information and schedule updates
      (780 267-8779) or deepwaterkungfu\@gmail.com .
