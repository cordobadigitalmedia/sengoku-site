        coverimage: /images/10-animal.jpg
        content: >
          10 Animal Style, also known as Heart & Mind Boxing (Xinyiliuhe),
          represents a rare internal Chinese martial arts system. It's
          considered a sister art to Tai Chi, offering a simpler and quicker
          path to internal martial arts mastery. The training strengthens the
          body and mind in layers, encompassing the muscular, fascia, and bone,
          as well as intellect, intention, and will. The practice involves
          mastering single drills and combinations of movements, both solo and
          in partner exercises.

          Drunken Fist, also known as Zuiquan, is a unique martial arts system
          that cultivates flexibility, speed, and adaptability in both mind and
          body. Practitioners appear to move like drunkards outwardly while
          remaining focused and sober inwardly. Shifu Neil Ripski, the
          instructor, has authored a comprehensive series of books titled
          "Secrets of Drunken Boxing" available on various platforms including
          Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Lulu.com.

          The Shaolin 18 Lohan Palm is a Buddhist training system that
          incorporates energy work (qigong) and meditation. Initially designed
          for monks as a daily practice to enhance both mind and internal energy
          (Qi/chi), it includes seated and moving meditation sessions, alongside
          teachings on fundamental Buddhist thought and Qigong exercises, akin
          to Chinese Yoga.
