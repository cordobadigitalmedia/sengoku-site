      ## Instructor: Sifu Matt Preston

      After stoking an interest in martial arts and training from a young age in Canada, it was time to set off abroad to explore the source of these combat and internal cultivation techniques. Along with other countries in Asia, Teacher Matthew Preston lived in Taiwan, Republic of China for over two decades, where he studied several authentic, traditional martial arts lineages. Rather than modern wushu dances with flowery forms, these arts originate from practical and well-known martial schools and instructors. This is as “authentic” as Kung Fu gets, and is quite unique to this part of the world. The main curriculum draws heavily from Xingyi Quan, Bagua Zhang, Taijiquan, as well as other Shaolin arts.

      ## Classes Taught

      Teacher Matthew currently runs the Deep Water Kung Fu & Tai Chi classes at the center, hoping to share this knowledge with as many people as possible in the local area. Get in touch for more information and schedule updates (780 267-8779) or [deepwaterkungfu@gmail.com](mailto\:deepwaterkungfu@gmail.com) .
